## FAQ

> Do i need the invitation to get in?

No, the invitation is to ensure you have the information you need to attend and RSVP. You may bring it on the day of the wedding, but it is not required.

> Black tie optional

Black tie-optional refers to a dress code in which a tuxedo/dinner jacket (black tie) is requested, but guests have the option to wear a dark business suit if they so choose. If you do not have a tuxedo/dinner jacket a dark suit is perfectly acceptable.

For women, it means you have the option of wearing a full-length gown or a cocktail dress.
