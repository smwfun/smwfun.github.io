## Hymn: Be thou my vision
 
<div style="text-align: center">
<br>
Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;<br>
naught be all else to me, save that thou art -<br>
thou my best thought, by day or by night;<br>
waking or sleeping, thy presence my light.<br>
<br>
Be thou my wisdom, and thou my true word;<br>
I ever with thee and thou with me, Lord.<br>
Thou my great Father; thine own may I be,<br>
thou in me dwelling and I one with thee.<br>
<br>
Riches I heed not, nor vain, empty praise;<br>
thou mine inheritance, now and always;<br>
thou and thou only first in my heart,<br>
high King of heaven, my treasure thou art.<br>
<br>
High King of heaven, my victory won,<br>
may I reach heaven’s joys, O bright heaven’s sun!<br>
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,<br>
still be my vision, O Ruler of all.<br>

Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

Thy kingdom come.

Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

## Introduction

## Recession

Thank you for attending what is a very special occasion for us.


> As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

> There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.

> - Ephesians 4: 1-6
